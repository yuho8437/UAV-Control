## UAV Control Projects

This project was implemented in the Fall semester of UNIST 2019 UAV Navigation & Flight Computer.

Project 1's C/A Code generator referenced Chapter 5 of the Fundamentals of Global Positioning System Receivers book, 

and Project 2's overall closed-loop system design referenced the course pdf slide.

### Project1

#### 1. C/A Code generator implementation example

### Project2

#### 1. Problem situation

UGV control simulation with closed-loop system in 2D

When entering the destination, control the wheel motor to move to the corresponding point and perform parallel parking
